# Unsupervised Multi-Token Circuit Finding



## Introduction



Since the introduction of dictionary learning techniques to the field of MI, rapid progress has been made in the development of general techniques to understand the computations performed by a transformer model trough the lens of interpretable units (Features) and their composition (Circuits).

This project builds upon prior literature on circuit finding techniques that leverage dictionary learning and present methods and results, with focusing on sequences of tokens, where the model has a high degree of certainty in it's predictions.
